                        <h3>Current</h3>
                        I am currently enrolled at Northwest Missouri State University (NW) in the Computer Science BS program.
                          I am in my third year of attendance, but I will graduate this spring in April.  
                          My goal for years has been to earn a career in software engineering and I am excited to get started.

                    <section class="col-md-5">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        I came to NW from Stanton, IA in the Fall 2016 semester with two semester's worth of credit completed.  
                        Having the ability to dual enroll in college courses while in high school was a huge opportunity that I took full advantage of.  
                        During my time at NW, I had the pleasure of working as a tutor and Supplemental Instruction Leader for the General Statistics course.  
                        I also taught a Statistics Strategies course once a week for students who needed a little extra guidance on certain topics.

                        <h3>Plans</h3>
                        My main career goal is to find a career in the Omaha area working as a software engineer on challenging and interesting subjects.  
                        I am also considering pursuing another internship before looking for a full-time position.  
                        Although I am working hard at becoming a full-fledged developer, I have also considered a career in database management or administration.
